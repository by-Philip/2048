        Yes, this is the original website of 2048, unfortunately there are other websites that have 'stolen' our concept and/or changed the identity of the developers of this game.

      Is there a 2048 mobile application? 
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item-body">
      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        No, unfortunately there isn't a mobile application of 2048.
          <br></br>
          <h4>Why?</h4>
        We were busy publishing a mobile app for Android and IOS. Unfortunately, other companies have stolen our concept and made an application themselves. As a result, we did not continue with the development.

    <div class="accordion-item-header">
      Why is 2048 in English and not in Dutch?
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item-body">
      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        This is a Dutch website. 2048 was developed and released in English a few years ago. We have deliberately chosen to make this known internationally and not only in the Netherlands. In the end we succeeded, other companies / developers copied our idea and after a while we got our website online. Now we have decided to republish 2048, but as 'math game / challenge / strategic game'. Also this time in English because we hope we can have a success again with this game. In the near future we want to add Dutch and other languages to the game.
